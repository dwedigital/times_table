# times_table
This is a simple exercise to help you practice string formatting, manipulation of variables (arithmetic) and loops.

1. Create a new git repository for your project

2. Create a new console application

3. Write code to print out the 2 times table

4. For the purposes of this assignment, we define a times table as the values from 1 * X to 12 * X

5. Format your output like this: 1 x 2 = 2

* To start with, write 12 lines of output, one for each individual statement - don’t use a loop even if it’s tempting

6. Rewrite your program to use a loop

7. Ask the user which times table they want at the start, and print that one out

8. Ask the user if they want to see another one (or to exit) when it’s finished

* Cope with bad input sensibly in both your questions for 5 and 6

9. Add an ‘all’ option which prints all the times tables from 1 to 12

* Hint: You’ll need a nested loop
